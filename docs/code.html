         <h3>Introduction</h3>
         <p class="content">The code has been developed as a tool to learn the basics
            of programming, specifically using the Python programming language.
            Specifically the main subjects covered were:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Variables</li>
            <li>Containers</li>
            <li>Control Structures</li>
            <li>Functions</li>
            <li>Classes</li>
            <li>Input and Output</li>
            <li>Modules</li>
            <li>Exceptions</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="content">This webpage will walk through the major parts of the code
            explaining the functions and class contained within. As well as the function
            of the model.
         </p>
         <h3>Operation of The Model</h3>
         <p class="content">The model can be run by opening in a graphical user
            interface (GUI) and selecting "run" from the relevant menu. It must be
            ensured that the file agentframework.py is contained within the current
            working directory (CWD) in order for the model.py file to import it. An
            environment file will also need to be stored in the CWD and needs to be named
            in.txt. An example file is provided in the GITHUB repository. In addition
            to running from a GUI, the model is also designed to be run from the command
            line using syntax such as `python3 model.py`. If using a Linux system, the
            model can also be started by entering the directory the model is saved and
            running <b>./model.py</b> if the file has been set to executable using CHMOD.
            For instructions on how to use CHMOD see 
            <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/932719">this</a> answer on 
            <a href="https://askubuntu.com">askubuntu.com</a>. But in short you
            can use <b>sudo CHMOD 755 model.py</b> to set the file to executable for all
            users. When using the command line to initiate the model you can provide
            three command line arguments (you need to provide exactly three otherwise
            the model uses the default values). The arguments change the following model
            parameters:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>num_of_agents (defaults to 10)</li>
            <li>num_of_iterations (defaults to 1)</li>
            <li>neighbourhood (defaults to 20)</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="content">The model begins by opening and importing the environment
            into list. Each row of the environment is placed as a list within this list.
            The model then checks the environment to make sure that all the rows are the
            same length. If the environment file is validated the agents are created and
            stored in a list named <b>agents</b>. The matplotlib figure is setup, the
            agents moved and the resources are collected and shared.
         </p>
         <p class="content">num_of_agents is the total number of agents initiated in 
            the model. num_of_iterations is the number of iterations the model calculates
            for each frame of the model run (which runs for a total of 100 frames). 
            neighbourhood is the minimum Euclidian distance between two agents which 
            allows them to share resources.
         </p>
         <h3>The model.py file</h3>
         <p class="content">The model.py file contains the main driver code for the
            model. The program imports the agent class, which it uses to create the
            agents which it stores in a python list. The program contains a number of
            functions, which are described as follows.
         </p>
         <h4>col_check</h4>
         <p class="content">A function to check that the provided environment file 
            contains rows which are all the same length. This is important so that the 
            agents consistently wrap around the world at the edge of the given 
            environment. The function returns True if all the rows are the same length, 
            False if they are not. If the environment does not meet these conditions, the
            model does not run and a message is printed to the command line.
         </p>
         <h4>update</h4>
         <p class="content">A function to update the frame of animation. The function
            is used in the FuncAnimation function of matplotlib and as such requires a
            positional argument which describes the current frame. See 
            <a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation.html">
            here</a> for more information. The function shuffles the agent list, so 
            that the agents are updated in a random order each frame, moves the agents
            and calls the eat and share functions of the agent objects. The function
            then plots the environment and the agents to complete the frame.
         </p>
         <h3>The agentframework.py File</h3>
         <p class="content">The agentframework.py file contains the agent class used 
            to generate each agent object. The module contains only the Agent class,
            which contains the following data:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>The agent's position in (x, y) format</li>
            <li>A copy of the environment the agent is in</li>
            <li>The store of resources the agent holds, in other words how full it is</li>
            <li>The number of rows and columns of the environment which are used to wrap
	   	   the agents around the environment (causing the environment to take the shape
	   	   of a torus)</li>
         </ul>
	    <h4>__init__</h4>
         <p class="content">The __init__ method initialises each agent passing in the environment,
	       the size of the world and a list of all the agents. The method sets a random position
	       for each agent created.</p>
         <h4>__str__</h4>
         <p class="content">The __str__ method is called when an object is passed to the print
	       function. It returns the Location of the agent printed.<p>
         <h4>get, set and del methods</h4>
         <p class="content">The get, set and del methods are used to control the access to the
	       class variables, and can be used to restrict how these variables are set. This is 
	   	achieved using the property function as explained 
	   	<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property">here</a><p>
         <h4>move</h4>
	    <p class="content">The move function takes a random floating point number from 0 to 1
	       and if the number is &lt 0.5, 1 is added to the y coordinate otherwise 1 is subtracted
	       from the y coordinate. A similar check is then performed for the x coordinate.</p>
         <h4>eat</h4>
	    <p class="content">The eat function checks if there are 10 or more resources in the 
	       agent's current location, and if there are it takes 10 resources and adds them to the
	       agent's store. If there are less than 10, the agent takes all available resources and
	       adds them to the store. Finally, if the agents store, as a result of adding the
	       resources, exceeds 100 then the entire store is emptied to the current location.</p>
         <h4>share_with_neighbours</h4>
	    <p class="content">The share_with_neighbours method checks to see if there are any other 
	       agents in the vicinity, and if there are it the agent shares resources with them. The
	       vicinity is determined by the neighbourhood variable of the model.</p>
         <h4>distance_between</h4>
	    <p class="content">The distance_between method calculates the euclidian distance between 
	       two agents and returns it as a float.</p>
         <h3>Potential Improvements to the Model</h3>
	    <p class="content">There are a number of improvements which could be made to the model
	       which could include:</p>
	    <p class="content"></p>
         <ul>
            <li>A command line argument could be added which would be used to specify the number
	   	   of frames the model runs for</li>
            <li>An option to run the model multiple times from the command line would be useful
	   	   especially in order to test the sensitivity of the model to certain parameters. The
	   	   model could save the results of these simulations in an external file for easy
	   	   examination.</li>
            <li>The matplotlib output changes the colour scale frequently - it would be better if
	   	   the scale used is kept constant.</li>
            <li>Implement code to make the agents move in a more realistic way, taking a list of
	 		  surrounding locations and randomly choosing from that. This is more realistic than
	 	   	  the current situation where the agents move one unit in the x direction AND one unit
	 	      in the y direction. This has the effect of the agents only moving diagonally, and
	 		  in fact there will be agents that could never land on the same location because
	 		  of this, similarly to how the bishops of one player cannot meet each other on the
	 		  chess board.</li>
	 	   <li>The model currently does not currently provide the user with feedback on how long
	 		  is left to run. Either a graphical column, or a text percentage complete would be
	 		  useful to add
	 	   </li>
         </ul>
