  <h3>Background</h3>
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p class="content">The code has been developed as a tool to learn the basics
  of programming, specifically using the Python programming language.
  Specifically the main subjects covered were:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Variables</li>
   <li>Containers</li>
   <li>Control Structures</li>
   <li>Functions</li>
   <li>Classes</li>
   <li>Input and Output</li>
   <li>Modules</li>
   <li>Exceptions</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="content">This webpage will walk through the major parts of the code
  explaining the functions and class contained within. As well as the function
  of the model.</p>
  <h4>The model function</h4>
  <p class="content">The model can be run by opening in a graphical user
  interface (GUI) and selecting "run" from the relevant menu. It must be
  ensured that the file agentframework.py is contained within the current
  working directory (CWD) in order for the model.py file to import it. An
  environment file will also need to be stored in the CWD and needs to be named
  in.txt. An example file is provided in the GITHUB repository. In addition
  to running from a GUI, the model is also designed to be run from the command
  line using syntax such as `python3 model.py`. If using a Linux system, the
  model can also be started by entering the directory the model is saved and
  running <b>./model.py</b> if the file has been set to executable using CHMOD.
  For instructions on how to use CHMOD see 
  <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/932719">this</a> answer on 
  <a href="https://askubuntu.com">askubuntu.com</a>. But in short you
  can use <b>sudo CHMOD 755 model.py</b> to set the file to excecutable for all
  users. When using the command line to initiate the model you can provide
  three command line arguments (you need to provide exactly three otherwise
  the model uses the default values). The arguments change the following model
  parameters:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>num_of_agents (defaults to 10)</li>
   <li>num_of_iterations (defaults to 1)</li>
   <li>neighbourhood (defaults to 20)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="content">num_of_agents is the total number of agents initiated in 
  the model. num_of_iterations is the number of iterations the model calculates
  for each frame of the model run (which runs for a total of 100 frames). 
  neighbourhood is the minimum euclidian distance between two agents which 
  allows them to share resources.</p>
<h4>The model.py file</h4>
  <p class="content">The model.py file contains the main driver code for the
  model. The programm imports the agent class, which it uses to create the
  agents which it stores in a python list. The program contains a number of
  functions, which are described as follows.</p>
  <h5>col_check</h5>
  <p class="content">A function to check that the provided environment file 
  contains rows which are all the same length. This is important so that the 
  agents consistently wrap around the world at the edge of the given 
  environment. The function returns True if all the rows are the same length, 
  False if they are not. If the environemnt does not meet these conditions, the
  model does not run and a message is printed to the command line.</p>
  <h5>update</h5>
  <p class="content">A function to update the frame of animation. The function
  is used in the FuncAnimation function of matplotlib and as such requires a
  positional argument which describes the current frame. See 
  <a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation.html">
	  here</a> for more information. The function shuffles the agent list, so 
  that the agents are updated in a random order each frame, moves the agents
  and calls the eat and share functions of the agent objects. The function
  then plots the environemnt and the agents to complete the frame.</p>

  <p class="content">Paragraph 5</p>
  <p class="content">Improvements</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Add command line arguments for number of frames</li>
   <li>Run the model multiple times from the command line</li>
   <li>The matplotlib output changes the colour scale frequently - figure out
   how to stabilise the colours.</li>
